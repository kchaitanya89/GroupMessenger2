# GroupMessenger2
Group messenger part B - Ordering guarantees for messages and handling node failures

add ordering guarantees to your group messenger. The guarantees you will implement are total ordering as well as FIFO ordering. As with part A, you will store all the messages in your content provider. The different is that when you store the messages and assign sequence numbers, your mechanism needs to provide total and FIFO ordering guarantees.
